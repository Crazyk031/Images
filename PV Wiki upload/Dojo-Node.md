With the Samourai Wallet it is best for Privacy to connect back to your own full node for queries.  Within the Samourai world, this node is know as Dojo.  

Besides privacy, connecting your Samourai Wallet to your own Dojo ensures you use Bitcoin the way it is meant to be used, fully independently and trust less. Using Dojo means using your own full node to power your wallet. By doing that you verify every single transaction and block for yourself. If you receive bitcoins with Dojo you can be 100% sure that it really happened. Your node will never accept an invalid transaction. To sum up: 

> Dojo = more privacy & security
